<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an ongoing build of my musical practice social app, freequency!
The full scope of and plan for this project, along with my ongoing Dev Journal, is available in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gWzqi_L2uPKPjtufqDp4NZdo3ObvkeuTdnaZCX6Eok/edit?usp=sharing).

The main goals of this application are to:
 * Build a community around practice
 * Encourage musicians to develop healthy practice routines
 * Celebrate practice 

In 2023 my idea for this app was more centered around repetitive practice and a looping tool to support it.. to see that v1 concept, check out this [demo of the UI](https://www.loom.com/share/3d44174f8a0d43c6812df4a966c41145) made on 5/11/23. 

In 2024, I shifted focus to the social aspect... an app to record and share when and how you practice, to get and recieve inspiration from fellow musicians. I consider this v2, and it's currently up at https://demo.freequencyapp.com/ for select users (limited by google auth at this stage). 

See an informal demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_GgxWh3f1VbKe9_hU6v53SSEZqBWUqE/view?usp=sharing). 

I am in the process of scoping the features for v3, as detailed in the above linked Google Doc. These features will enhance the social aspect, and provide for more robust tracking of your practice.
