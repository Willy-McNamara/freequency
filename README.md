<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an updated build of my music practice and social app, freequency!

The main goals of this application are to:
 * Allow users to track their practice habits over time
 * Provide a useful tool for chunking and looping over songs (helpful when learning music by ear!)
 * Create a space for practice itself to be shared and celebrated! 

To get a feel for how this app will look and function, please check out this [demo of the UI](https://www.loom.com/share/3d44174f8a0d43c6812df4a966c41145) made on 5/11/23.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Please contact me for instructions on using this repo!


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Check out my [UI demo](https://www.loom.com/share/3d44174f8a0d43c6812df4a966c41145) to get a taste for how this app will be used! 
You can also see some examples of where this came from by visiting my [v0, a web app](https://github.com/Willy-McNamara/Freequency), a bootcamp project I stood up in 2 days.



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### Sprints

Design Sprint
 * Define a PRD
 * Wire frames that outline the user experience for v1. 
 * Define rules for color palette 
 * Capture and diagram the goals for data use and data flow in v1.
 * Mock schema of back end to match these goals
 * Update readme
 * Define Git workflow
 * Define Testing workflow

Basic Build Sprint
 * Stand up a basic implementation of the front end using new tech stack
 * Scaffold back end using new tech stack
 * Create an ETL file which can be used to seed and reseed the database with mock data when I make changes! 
 * Seed the database 

Feature Sprint: Authorization
 * Implement basic authorization
 * Standup functioning log-in and sign-up pages. 
 * Update backend schemas to accommodate auth data. 

Feature Sprint: Dovetailed Sessions and Recordings
 * Structure database such that recordings are coordinated with sessions, and can be referenced in the same chronology. 
Feature Sprint: Sessions Feed
 * Some method of viewing all sessions and recordings in chronological order, perhaps exactly like strava, but for these practice sessions. 

Feature Sprint: Improved Playback
 * Implement playback which allows the user to change the looped section in real time using sliders
 * Build this in a sandbox with react native to begin learning mobile principals! 

Final Build and Polish Sprint
 * Make sure everything is playing nice in the sandbox! 

Deployment Sprint
 * Deploy v1 to AWS.  


Keeping track of potential features to implement for v2:
 * The ability to ‘connect’ with certain people. Maybe add them to your band? Some way to limit who can view your stuff, and a main feed populated specifically by your friends posts.
 * Notifications! Some mechanism for being made aware of engagement with your posts. 
 * Stay logged in - ideally users will not have to log in again if they visit the service regularly.
