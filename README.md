<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an updated build of my musical practice social app, freequency!
The full scope of and plan for this project, along with my ongoing Dev Journal, is available in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gWzqi_L2uPKPjtufqDp4NZdo3ObvkeuTdnaZCX6Eok/edit?usp=sharing).

The main goals of this application are to:
 * Build a community around practice
 * Encourage musicians to develop healthy practice routines
 * Celebrate practice 

In 2023 my idea for this app was more centered around repetitive practice and a looping tool to support it.. to see that v1 concept, check out this [demo of the UI](https://www.loom.com/share/3d44174f8a0d43c6812df4a966c41145) made on 5/11/23. 

Now in 2024, I am focusing the just on the social aspect... an app to record and sharing notes on your practice sessions, to get and recieve practice inspiration from fellow musicians.
